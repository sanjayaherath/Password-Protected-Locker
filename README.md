# Password-Protected-Locker

## Introduction ##

Thiss was developed for third year first semester project for the course EE322-Embedded Systems. A prototype password protected locker was developed from PIC assembly from scratch.

**Group Members:** [Sanjaya Herath](https://sanjayaherath.github.io/), Madri Madawala, and Ishara Madushan.

**Supervised by:** [Dr. Uditha Navaratne](http://eng.pdn.ac.lk/deee/staff/academic/mr.us.navaratne/profile.php) and [Dr. Nalin Harischandra](http://eng.pdn.ac.lk/deee/staff/academic/dr.wani.harischandra/profile.php)

## Project Overview ##

Assembly was used in programming the PIC microcontroller-16f873A. Programs were developed in MPLABX IDE. Simulated in Proteus and successfully developed a prototype product.
The codes are available for taking inputs from a keypad, displaying messages in a LCD display and controlling a servo motor with PWM signals.
